-- Solving with recurence relations. This very problem is
-- seen in "How to solve it", by George PÃ³lya. It is way
-- faster then enumerating all solutions.

-- Function a returns how many coins are needed to
-- produce target with coins 200 and below. Either we use
-- a 200 coin and the problem reduces to producing
-- target-200, or we don't and the problem reduces to
-- producing target with coins 100 and below.
